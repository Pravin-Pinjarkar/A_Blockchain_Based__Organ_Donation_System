Overview

The Blockchain-Based Decentralized Organ Donation System is a secure and transparent platform designed to improve trust, traceability, 
and efficiency in organ donation and transplantation processes. By leveraging blockchain technology,
the system eliminates data tampering, ensures donor-recipient authenticity, and maintains immutable medical records.
This project addresses major challenges such as fraud, lack of transparency, delayed coordination, and centralized data vulnerabilities in traditional organ donation systems.
